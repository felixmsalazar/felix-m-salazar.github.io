## Welcome

This repository contains a collection of my projects in financial modeling, focusing on foreign exchange, credit market analysis, and more.

## Project Highlights

Projects utilize data from professional financial platforms:

- **Bloomberg's BQuant**: Cloud-based analytics platform for financial professionals
- **XBBG**: Python wrapper for the Bloomberg API, facilitating data retrieval and analysis

## Note on Proprietary Technologies

Some projects in this repository were also developed using BlackRock's Aladdin platform, specifically leveraging BQL (BlackRock Query Language) for querying cloud-based databases within the Aladdin ecosystem. Due to the proprietary nature of this technology:

- Sections of code utilizing BQL have been omitted from this public repository.
- Project descriptions and methodologies are presented without disclosing proprietary information.
- Where applicable, alternative approaches or pseudocode may be provided to illustrate concepts.

This approach ensures compliance with confidentiality agreements while still demonstrating the scope and complexity of the work performed.

While these data sources may not be universally accessible, the methodologies demonstrate analytical approaches relevant to finance professionals and researchers.
