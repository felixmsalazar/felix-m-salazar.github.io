# Portfolio Analysis Tool
## Overview
This project involves the development of a portfolio analysis tool focusing on currency hedging and yield calculations for fixed income securities. The tool integrates financial data from Bloomberg using BQL and XBBG libraries to analyze portfolio metrics and FX hedging contributions.

## Key Features
Data Retrieval: The tool fetches data on holdings, yields, and durations from Bloomberg APIs.

Currency Hedging: It calculates hedging costs and contributions for regular currencies and non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Portfolio Metrics: The tool computes weighted average yield and duration for the portfolio.

FX Hedging Integration: It incorporates FX hedging contributions to calculate a hedged yield.

Reporting: The tool generates portfolio metrics and FX hedging contribution reports.

## Technical Details
Libraries Used: The project uses Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and xbbg.

Data Processing: It handles data aggregation, weighting, and hedged yield calculations.

Error Handling: The tool includes error handling for unsupported currencies and data inconsistencies.

## Project Structure
The tool is organized around functions that manage data retrieval, hedging cost calculations, and portfolio metric computations. It also includes input functions for user interaction.

## Use Cases
This tool is useful for financial analysts and portfolio managers interested in optimizing fixed income portfolios through currency hedging strategies. It provides insights into hedged yields and FX contributions, enhancing portfolio performance and risk management.
