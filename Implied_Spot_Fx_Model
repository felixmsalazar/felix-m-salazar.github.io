Currency Analysis Tool
Overview
This project involves the development of a sophisticated currency analysis tool focusing on purchasing power parity (PPP) and implied exchange rates. The tool leverages financial data from Bloomberg to analyze currency trends and inflation differentials between countries.

Key Features
Data Retrieval: Utilizes Bloomberg APIs to fetch FX and inflation data.

Implicit FX Rate Calculation: Calculates implied FX rates based on inflation differentials.

Data Management: Employs a structured class-based approach to manage currency data and calculations.

Visualization and Analysis: Generates summary statistics and visualizations to compare real spot FX rates with implied rates.

Flexibility: Offers flexible date range selection and grouping options.

Technical Details
Libraries Used: The project relies on Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and xbbg for data manipulation and Bloomberg API interactions.

Data Processing: Handles data resampling, percentage change calculations, and cumulative product computations for inflation indices.

Error Handling: Includes error handling for unsupported currencies.

Project Structure
The tool is organized around a core class that encapsulates currency data and implicit FX rate calculations. It also includes functions for data retrieval, inflation index construction, and comparison of real and implied FX rates.
